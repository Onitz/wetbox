</div>
<div class="content">Currently a 3rd year graphic design student, I'm an Australian who's primary passions include web <br />design, and 3D-CG design. 
<br /><br />While designing, I always opt to prioritise function over form. <br />
I'm a fan of concise design <br />that is beautiful and to-the-point. 
<br /><br />Difference and superiority must be bold. It must be targeted. And like any revolutionary idea, <br />it must take risks.
<br /><br />Convention is creativity's worst enemy.</div>

  title="The font Enig (abbreviated: enigma) Is a mono-spaced, round serif font intended for use in programming and body-print text. The font was part of a major project in my 3rd year uni folio and took a considerable amount of time to perfect.">

  title="The design for the book cover: Cool Hotels, Cool prices. Intended as a budget-saver for holiday makers, the intent behind the design was to create the cover in a manner that catches viewers attention in store and to stand out among the shelves. Although aimed at budget sellers, it does not necessarily have to be tacky.">

  title="The Droste effect is a prolific graphic anomaly where an infinitely recurring image is shown (one inside the other, inside the other etc). The original package,  introduced in 1904 was a picture of a nurse holding a package with another picture of a nurse and so on. Although this was a hard product to redesign, the end result still contained the concept, only in a more modern fashion.">

  title="The purpose behind this brief was to create a corporate identity in the form of a logo for the Newcastle Institute of Energy and Resources (NIER). The logo was to run along the lines of representing aspects of research, clean energy and resources, and/or environmental / social benefits. The meaning this design was ecological prosperity through research. The benzene ring is both an eminent chemical sign as well as a clearly-recognizable shape delivering a strong result. The line entering from the left and exiting / sprouting out the right over a bed of soil entails the research process as moving forward (as read from left to right).">

  title="The ambigram is a quote from the famous 17th century French philosopher and mathematician, Rene Descartes (pronounced des-cart) . On one side, the phrase reads cogito ergo sum, while on the other, its English translation: i think thus, i am (thus being a substitution for therefore to unify character count). The original brief was to design a tattoo for yourself. I chose to do an ambigram of this quote because I desired a deeper meaning to accompany something beautiful to etch into my skin.">

  <a href="images/showcase/Andrew_Dabson-7_freelancer.png" rel="lightbox[folio]" name="Freelancer logo" 
  title="The freelancer logo was designed as part of a competition for the site: freelancer.com. The logo had to work in 2 colors (black and white). I designed it with the intent of portraying networking (the three stems coming from a single source), while also recognizing that a freelancer is usually only just one step in the problem-solution process. A drop in the ocean, so to speak.">

  title="This image was created solely as a hobby in 3ds max. The end result was more or less a consequence of a series of lighting experiments which rendered some rather gorgeous results. The overall cleanliness and lightness of detail, while unrealistic delivered a unique style which I personally found aesthetically pleasing and good enough to include in this folio.">

  title="The Corbusier chair is a designer lounge which I self-modeled and surfaced using a texturing tutorial on 3ds max. The render time was noticeably long and used a lot of tricks in the vRay rendering engine to achieve near-photorealism.">

  title="This graphic was a discarded piece in my solution to the cool hotels, cool prices book cover (see 3). It was ultimately rendered with about 6 omni lights illuminating the stems from varying directions to produce a cool, crystal effect. Unfortunately, it looks much better on screen then it does on print making it unfeasible for the brief, but striking nonetheless.">

  title="A product illustration for a pair of RadioShack wireless headphones. Everything was manually hand-illustrated with the pen tool, gradient ramps and various other tools and effects in Adobe illustrator (ear pads were auto-traced). As a  final piece, I was very satisfied with this work (huge time investment for intricate detail).">

  title="Voxellation is a process similar to pixilation, but in 3d whereby an image can be mapped using cubes (voxels) instead of squares (pixels). This representation  doesn't necessarily reflect the concept, rather is intended as a fun, cute and creepy background image. The font used is Rabid Science.">

  title="Created using 3ds max in a manner similar to the boat scene, but with less detail water surface textures and lighting. The picture is a piece of fine art more than anything else. Not seeking excessive beauty or realism, this is an image of relaxation, abstraction and simplicity.">
